14:44:09	 From  charmain : Background:The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidityconditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless nodetransmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wirelessdata was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minuteswith m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (ChievresAirport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru),and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column.
